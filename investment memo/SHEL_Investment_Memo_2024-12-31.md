**DCF Model Fair Price:** $148.17 **Market Price:** $59.31

**Executive Summary:**
Shell plc (SHEL) is UNDERVALUED with substantial long-term upside potential. The primary driver is its robust strategic investments in key growth areas like LNG, coupled with strong commitments to shareholder returns and significant cost reductions, which are not currently reflected in its market price.

**Advantages & Disadvantages:** 
Shell's strategic advantages include a $50 billion LNG project in Argentina and an £8 billion UK North Sea joint venture, positioning it for future growth. The company consistently prioritizes shareholder returns through ongoing $3.5 billion share buyback programs and has achieved $3.9 billion in structural cost reductions. The DCF model indicates a significant undervaluation of nearly 150%. Conversely, recent performance shows disadvantages: Q2 2025 income declined due to lower margins and prices, gearing increased to 19.1%, and financial ratios indicate a profitability and growth downturn in 2023-2024.

**Risks:**
Key risks include persistent macroeconomic headwinds, particularly weak Chinese economic activity, which could depress commodity markets. Shell's increased gearing raises financial leverage concerns. Critically, there is a clear conflict between the highly bullish DCF valuation and the bearish short-to-medium term technical indicators. While the market sentiment suggests the stock may have "overshot" on the downside, implying a potential recovery if macro conditions stabilize, current technicals (RSI below 50, negative MACD, price below MA_20/MA_50) indicate immediate downward pressure.

**Final Verdict:**
We issue a BUY recommendation for Shell plc. Despite short-term financial headwinds and bearish technical indicators, the company's strategic long-term investments, commitment to shareholder returns, and significant undervaluation by our DCF model present a compelling opportunity. Our target price, based on the DCF fair value, is $148.17. This position is for long-term investors willing to navigate short-term volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties.
